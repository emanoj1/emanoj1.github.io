Hey there, I’m Manoj Kumar, currently based in Sydney, Australia. Nice to meet you!

### Things I do!

I love all things related to the internet - ecommerce, social media, digital advertising, web development and content creation!
Check out my YouTube travel vlog at [Check Out Australia](https://youtube.com/@checkoutaustralia)
I've also begun my journey as an indie author, having published my first kid's illustrated book [Chester, the purple dino](https://chesterthedino.com) in 2024. 

### About this blog

I have a personal blog at [emanoj.com](https://emanoj.com) where I write about things that interest me. Please check it out when you have time. However, this gitHub blog is specific to coding related writing.

### My career

My career journey covers a wide variety of industries – sales (direct and retail), student community building, international education, business development, ad operations, ad tech, operational excellence, project management and web development.

### Bootstrapped ventures

I love bringing to life web apps that I've thought of! These are my launches so far:
[education.cv](https://education.cv) An online space to showcase everything you've studied!
[fitnessleafai.com](https://fitnessleafai.com) AI-generated vegetarian recipes to match your daily calorie limits!

### Full-stack web development

In 2023, I began my journey to learn and practice coding: HTML/CSS, Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, NodeJS, React and MongoDB. I've also worked with No-code platforms like Wordpress, Webflow, Softr, Wix, SquareSpace and Shopify.
