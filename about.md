Hey there! Iâ€™m Manoj Kumar, currently based in Sydney, Australia. Nice to meet you!

### Bootstrapped ventures

I love bringing to life web apps that I've thought of! These are my launches so far:

I've also begun my journey as an indie author, publishing my first kid's illustrated book [Chester, the Purple Dino](https://chesterthedino.com) in 2024.
